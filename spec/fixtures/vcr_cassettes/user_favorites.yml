        \"customer service\" westvleteren trappist \"cyrus farivar\" beer scarcity
        \"black market\"","permalink":"99-invisible-55-the-best-beer","description":"If
        you\u2019re a beer nerd, or have a friend who\u2019s a beer nerd, you\u2019ve
        heard of Belgian beers. Belgians take beer very seriously. Amongst the 200
        Belgian breweries, there\u2019s a very specific sub-type: Trappist beers.
        \r\n\r\nAccording to our reporter Cyrus Farivar (also from Episode #36 \u201cSuper
        Bonn Bon\u201d), there are two things you need to know about Trappist beers.
        First, they\u2019re amazing. Second, they\u2019re made by Trappist monks.
        These monks trace their roots to a monastery in 17th century France, and have
        since spread out to all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe main concept behind the
        Trappist lifestyle is that the abbey should be economically self-sufficient.
        In other words, the monks should make something and sell it to the public
        as a way to fund the operations of the abbey itself. Some make cheese. Some
        make spirits. There\u2019s even one in Germany that makes lentil soup. But
        none of the Trappist products are as famous as the beer.\r\n\r\nThe beer that
        is considered the best of the best is Westvleteren 12. With its plain brown
        bottle, no label, the only writing is on the cap- the beer is super cool.
        It\u2019s quite rare and year after year it\u2019s rated the best beer in
        the world.\r\n\r\nBut here\u2019s the thing about Westvleteren. You can\u2019t
        just go there and have as much beer as you want. You can\u2019t even have
        it shipped from the abbey. If you want to buy beer to take with you, you have
        to look up the beer reservation phone number on the abbey\u2019s website.
        Then, you call certain phone number during certain hours, on certain days.\r\n\r\nIf
        you\u2019re lucky enough to talk to a monk to take your reservation, you have
        to give your license plate number and be available to come pick up your crate
        during the appointed time that weekend. You\u2019re limited to one crate per
        person per car, maximum two per car. And, you can\u2019t buy more than one
        crate during a 60-day period. You also have to agree not to resell the beer.\r\n\r\nThis
        sort of thing is not unheard of: velvet ropes and random reward have long
        been imposed to create artificial scarcity to heighten demand, but the mainstream
        trend today seems to be more geared toward greater access and accommodation
        for customers. The new ideal is that everything is available, at all times,
        no matter where you live. Yet the Westvleteren Trappists are trying to make
        it as difficult as possible.\r\n\r\nJef van den Steen, author of a book called
        \u201cTrappist: The Seven Heavenly Beers\u201d and an acclaimed brewer himself,
        says that\u2019s not the case, \u201cBefore, Westvleteren was only well-known
        was in Belgium. And now it\u2019s worldwide, and that\u2019s the problem.
        They decide we will brew the same amount as the last 40-50 years, and they
        have enough for that, so why must they brew more? Because you want? No. They
        live between the walls of the abbey, so for them it\u2019s not a problem.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe
        \u201ccustomer service\u201d is not designed to provide convenience for the
        consumer of their beer, it is designed for monks themselves. Their \u201ccustomer\u201d
        is God. They have a mission, and making beer is only a fraction of that. The
        Head of the Abbey says, \"We are not brewers. We are monks. We brew beer to
        be able to afford being monks.\"\r\n\r\nCyrus Farivar recently returned to
        California after having lived in Bonn, Germany for two years. These days,
        he can be found frequenting The Trappist bar in downtown Oakland. He plans
        on presenting a bottle of Westvleteren 12 to his favorite bar owners. His
        book, \"The Internet of Elsewhere,\" was published last year.\r\n","streamable":true,"downloadable":true,"genre":"public
