        http://www.beatport.com/release/jive-talk/909277\r\n\r\nNitetime is the new
        production duo from Boston, USA comprised of Kon (from Kon \u0026 Amir) and
        Whisky Baron which was first sent to us by fellow Bostonians - Soul Clap.
        Nitetime\u2019s debut EP Jive Talk sits between OG boom bap hip hop - with
        its tough drums and grooved up interludes - and the 4/4 rhythms of classic
        house and disco. It also comes packed with a little more history than meets
        the eye\u2026\r\n\r\nWho better to describe the tracks and history than Kon
        himself?\r\n\r\n\"All the People\" is a classic throwback to 88-92 era of
        house, lots of 909s and what not, \"Teddys Jam \" is sort of a deeper, slower
        late night track, dark and moody with banging drums and \"Jive Talk\" is a
        crazy sounding synth riff, George Duke-ish block party vibe\u2026 congas and
        stuff going on.\r\n\r\nThen the interludes in between kinda tie the tunes
        together. I feel thats missing from EP''s and full lengths... and I''ve never
        heard it done on dance records. De la Soul and Pete Rock would have these
        amazing little beats, and its just bringing it back.\"\r\n\r\nOn the digital
        EP you can pick up Soul Clap\u2019s extra laidback remix of Hey! which was
        specially mixed by Lee Curtis of Spectral Sound / Get Physical fame. This
        also marks Soul Clap\u2019s second remix on Future Classic - hopefully you\u2019ve
        checked out their chunky drum remix of Mario \u0026 Vidis euro anthem \u2018Changed\u2019!\r\n\r\nThe
        EP has only just been pressed to wax and it''s already picking up love from
        Gilles Peterson, Jacques Renault, Eli Escobar, Soul Clap, Recloose, Frank
        Booker, Karizma, Lefto from Belgium and Lovemonk in Madrid. Don''t let this
        record slip through those dusty fingers of yours.","streamable":true,"downloadable":false,"genre":"House","release":"FCL71","purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/jive-talk/909277","purchase_title":null,"label_id":null,"label_name":"Future
