        Classic is excited to announce a new signing - a new band to emerge from Sydney''s
        bubbling live music scene lead by Jarrah McCleary called Panama.\r\n\r\nA
        classically trained pianist from the age of six, Jarrah McCleary grew up in
        the sticky heat of the Northern Territory. \u00a0His previous project, The
        Dirty Secrets saw the band working between Australia and London with iconic
        producer and engineer, Nick Terry (Klaxons, Libertines).\r\n\r\nThe first
        single from Panama is Magic, a modern summer anthem and something sure to
        warm you up if you''re stuck in winter. Magic was produced and mixed in Los
        Angeles by Eric Broucek of DFA fame (Holy Ghost, Eleanor Friedberger, !!!)
        and will be released on vinyl with remixes by Permanent Vacation regulars
        Midnight Magic (you might of spotted their remix in The Magician''s Magictape
        24) and DFA heavyweight Gavin Russom (LCD Soundsystem \u0026 The Crystal Ark).
        Magic has been picking up lots of love from Australian radio too with triple
        j and community radio already getting behind it.\r\n\r\nPanama''s live show
        is already a huge hit having supported Dappled Cities, Parachute Youth and
        Elizabeth Rose (recorded for Live Feed on FBi 94.5). If you want to catch
        Panama''s stellar live show in the flesh they''ll be supporting Van She in
        Melbourne and Sydney as well as playing UNSW Roundhouse and supporting Northeast
        Party House at Goodgod Small Club in July.","streamable":true,"downloadable":true,"genre":"DISCO","release":"FCL74","purchase_url":"http://www.beatport.com/release/magic/939494","purchase_title":null,"label_id":null,"label_name":"Future
