        in the last very few months in the EDM industry inside the island. Producing
        since he was 17, SirK has developed piano playing and drum set skills to the
        level that has been making his tracks the perfect combination of anthemic
        an rhythmic progressive sounds, with hard-pounding percussion that make his
        repertoire one of a kind. \n\n     Original Mixes like \"The Descendant\"
        and \"The Extra Mile\" have been played not all over Puerto Rico, but in other
        countries around the globe, like Spain, Australia, Italy, Turkey and many
        more. Now at his 21 years of age, Christian is planning to study further and
        go deep into the EDM business, and also has been performing over the radio,
        and over the internet. SirK not only intends to make a name for himself and
        his country, he intends to bring the joy and the beautiful sound of dance
        music to the rest of the world, and he''s just getting started.","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"sirkofficial","website":null,"website_title":null,"online":false,"track_count":39,"playlist_count":0,"public_favorites_count":56,"followers_count":945,"followings_count":1988},{"id":6127510,"kind":"user","permalink":"tyronerubik","username":"TyroneRubik","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/6127510","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/tyronerubik","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000007266588-1x605a-large.jpg?b9fd227","country":"Spain","full_name":"Tyrone

        House Moguls\u2014Are house music junkies, literally. United as a duo in 2006,
        their unique style of combining classic house samples with pulsating electronic
        melodies has led to their original productions being featured in primetime
        T.V. shows, showcased during the Cannes Music Festival and licensed throughout
        the world. Remixes are their other strong suit. Artists like: Daft Punk, Deadmau5,
        Crookers, Basement Jaxx, Common, David Guetta \u0026 Mighty Dub Kats have
        all experienced a House Mogul\u2019esque facelift\u2014appealing to a more
        diverse audience and expanding into newer horizons.\n\nThe House Moguls continue
        spending countless hours of their time in the studio, glued to their keyboards
        and staring at the computer screen, because they\u2019re passionate about
        what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s all about pushing the dance scene to the next
        level,\u201d explains Basil. \u201cWe challenge each other everyday to bring
        something new and innovative to whatever project we\u2019re working on\u2014but
        don\u2019t believe for one second that we\u2019re not having fun while doing
        it.\u201d His partner in crime couldn\u2019t agree more, \u201cWe\u2019re
        always striving to be better than the day before,\u201d says Calderone, \u201cand
        it\u2019s a great feeling that we can deliver music that sends chills down
        our backs.\u201d\n\nWith their current productions already supported by world
        renowned DJs and producers alike, The House Moguls plan to broaden their influence
        in the upcoming future by taking their skills on the road and showcasing their
        talents live. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to sit in a room and listen to your
        tracks through studio monitors,\u201d says Calderone, \u201cbut it\u2019s
        a completely different experience when you get to bring your sound to hundreds
        of people in the same setting. We treat each live performance as an opportunity
        to craft our sound\u2014and the more we play, the more our sound will grow.\u201d
        With the endless determination of bringing something fresh and appealing to
        each project, The House Moguls look to have a very bright\u2014and very busy\u2014future
        ahead of them. \n","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"thehousemoguls","website":"http://www.thehousemoguls.com","website_title":"The
