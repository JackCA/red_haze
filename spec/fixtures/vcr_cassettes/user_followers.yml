        Pattiata, born on 28 August 1990, also known by his artist name Hoodie, is
        a Dutch music producer \u0026 DJ. At age 10 he discovers music on a children\u2019s
        program on his fathers computer. Obsessed by a monkey and a drum kit he developed
        his interest in music at a very young age. Music was not a strange thing in
        his family. His uncle played in several bands and his cousin was a well-known
        DJ. When Dani\u00ebl moved to Amersfoort, he and his new friends decided to
        begin a rap group. Unfortunately nobody knew a thing about computers and making
        music so Hoodie tried to make some himself. \r\n\r\nIn 2003 he discovers a
        new way to make music and made dozens of hip-hop beats with FL Studio. All
        those beats gave him exercise to give all the instruments the perfect level.\r\nWhen
        Hoodie decided to start with something new he bought Cubase from the local
        music store. In 2006 he was still into hip-hop, but he also want to try something
        new. Searching for a different genre he discovers House music. Dani\u00ebl
        was instantaneously in love and he started to make some House right away.  In
        2008 he released his first single at Sneakerz Muzik (Spinnin Records), which
        wasn\u2019t a success after all. \r\n\r\nHis second release \u2018Dirty Maluku
        Style\u2019on Made2dance Records made a huge difference. Supported by DJ\u2019s
        Gregor Salto, Dj Rockid, Schlachtofbronx, Teki Latex, Yolanda BE Cool and
        many more, he had made his first success. In 2010 he released \u2018Break
        Bass\u2019 which was a mix of Electro and Dutch House. It was released on
        Foktop! (Spinnin Records) and was published on CD as well (Sneakerz Foktop!
        Summer CD). After all the releases Hoodie had those few years, he got much
        respect and support from DJ\u2019s and fans from all over the world. \r\n\r\nDani\u00ebl\u2019s
        DJ career started a few months later in 2010. His first gigs were at local
        bars and parties but after the Foktop! Summer Mix cd he was booked at his
        first big party with Bizzey, Sandro Silva, DJ Rockid and some other DJ\u2019s.
        After all those gigs with DJ\u2019s like: The Partysquad, Sandro Silva, Rockid,
        Yolanda BE Cool, Marc Benjamin etc. Hoodie had a promising future full of
        big releases and collaborations with producers and DJ\u2019s from his dreams.
        Hoodie is now known as a wild DJ and a gifted producer and we\u2019re all
        hyped to hear what\u2019s next in the future!","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":"http://www.hoodiemusic.com","website_title":"Official

        House Moguls\u2014Are house music junkies, literally. United as a duo in 2006,
        their unique style of combining classic house samples with pulsating electronic
        melodies has led to their original productions being featured in primetime
        T.V. shows, showcased during the Cannes Music Festival and licensed throughout
        the world. Remixes are their other strong suit. Artists like: Daft Punk, Deadmau5,
        Crookers, Basement Jaxx, Common, David Guetta \u0026 Mighty Dub Kats have
        all experienced a House Mogul\u2019esque facelift\u2014appealing to a more
        diverse audience and expanding into newer horizons.\n\nThe House Moguls continue
        spending countless hours of their time in the studio, glued to their keyboards
        and staring at the computer screen, because they\u2019re passionate about
        what they do. \u201cIt\u2019s all about pushing the dance scene to the next
        level,\u201d explains Basil. \u201cWe challenge each other everyday to bring
        something new and innovative to whatever project we\u2019re working on\u2014but
        don\u2019t believe for one second that we\u2019re not having fun while doing
        it.\u201d His partner in crime couldn\u2019t agree more, \u201cWe\u2019re
        always striving to be better than the day before,\u201d says Calderone, \u201cand
        it\u2019s a great feeling that we can deliver music that sends chills down
        our backs.\u201d\n\nWith their current productions already supported by world
        renowned DJs and producers alike, The House Moguls plan to broaden their influence
        in the upcoming future by taking their skills on the road and showcasing their
        talents live. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to sit in a room and listen to your
        tracks through studio monitors,\u201d says Calderone, \u201cbut it\u2019s
        a completely different experience when you get to bring your sound to hundreds
        of people in the same setting. We treat each live performance as an opportunity
        to craft our sound\u2014and the more we play, the more our sound will grow.\u201d
        With the endless determination of bringing something fresh and appealing to
        each project, The House Moguls look to have a very bright\u2014and very busy\u2014future
        ahead of them. \n","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"thehousemoguls","website":"http://www.thehousemoguls.com","website_title":"The
