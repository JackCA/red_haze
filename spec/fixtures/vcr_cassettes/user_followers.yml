        John McGhee aka CJ (CESAY) and Michael McGhee aka Vivvid first cousins both
        born and raised in Oakland California. They both have been making music since
        the age of 10, their musical talents come from their fathers(brothers) who
        have written many songs that has never been heard by the public. Yes old school
        music mixed with todays high tech sounds creating an original sound of their
        own is what these guys represent. From rap, r \u0026 b, hip hop and rock with
        a spice of their own flavor, these guys are open and ready anytime for that
        big day to arrive! , Mikey is an excellent gifted keyboard, pianist \r\n,
        and organ player with the natural given talent with a voice that comes along
        with his package that touches the soul. With his rough raspy voice, CJ has
        the force factor, giving the hard heart felt throbing beat that makes this
        unique contagious blend of music to the ear! The power of lyrics and song
        writing is CJ''s gift. Once CJ and Mikey put a song together \"BEATS ON HIT\"...
        the passion that the songs bring, these guys are aweome, they do not copy
        other peoples songs. They say''their way or the highway\". At the tinder age
        of 21 the sounds that are created comes from the heart and the experience
        of their up bringing in Oakland and Richmond Ca. of which they have lost many
        friends to the game and life on the streets. Lil Mikey continues to play gospel
        music for bay area churches weekly and CJ is a dedicated Veterinarian Technician
        for the City of San Francisco. There are plenty more sounds where these came
        from so keep your ears open and keep checking in on these guys they are very
        inspirational individuals. We really appreciate all of your support and look
        forward to doing business with someone out there who has the faith in us that
        we have in ourselves for a record deal. Our first CD will be coming soon.We
        thank all of you for following our music and appreciate your comments as well.
        So until next time god bless you all. LET''S KEEP THE MUSIC GOING-follow my
        brother NYJIS MCGHEE on SOUND CLOUD. JUST ONE MORE NOTE WE''VE ADDED A NEW
        ADDITION TO OUR PROFILE, MR PIANOMAN FROM NAMBIA, MR PIANOMAN HAS GREATLY

        ","description":"Since the inception of the band in 2009, Juice has become
        a major up-and-coming force in the Toronto music scene. Juice has headlined
        legendary Toronto venues including the Horseshoe Tavern, the El Mocambo, the
        Silver Dollar Room, Mitzi''s Sister, Clinton''s Tavern, and Lee\u2019s Palace.
        Juice can also be seen playing at universities and colleges throughout Ontario,
        having already added Waterloo, Humber, Trent, and Queens to their list. Mixing
        the roots of Rock/Funk/Jazz/R\u0026amp;B with Pop melodies and Hip-Hop grooves,
        Juice has an original sound that appeals to all music lovers.\nSmooth vocals,
        a heavy-hitting rhythm section, tight horns, a fiery M.C., not to mention
        their intense live shows, all combine to create an unforgettable experience.
        After seeing the band perform live, the independent Toronto music critic The
        Lonely Vagabond described Juice saying \u201cMixing hip-hop, funk, and sun-drenched
        70''s pop, this is an energy-fueled sound that will make you hit the dance
        floor!\u201d Juice challenges mainstream ideas about music by blurring the
        lines between genres, focusing on energy and excitement, as well as placing
        a high importance on connecting with their audience.\n A bright and busy future
        lays ahead for the band, having just released their debut 6 song EP and EPK
        entitled Nine Nineteen to rave reviews. Over the course of the next year Juice
        will be playing and touring in Quebec and Ontario, along with writing/arranging/recording
        their full length album which is scheduled to be released in the summer of
        2012.Keep an eye (and an ear) out for Juice because there''s no doubt they''ll
        be playing at an event near you!\n\n","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":null,"website":null,"website_title":null,"online":true,"track_count":7,"playlist_count":1,"public_favorites_count":0,"followers_count":822,"followings_count":1478},{"id":11726769,"kind":"user","permalink":"can-so-u-l-e-d","username":"Can.So[u]l[e]d","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/11726769","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/can-so-u-l-e-d","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000012439625-0xlph4-large.jpg?96679da","country":"United

        \n\"i love music. i always will. it saved my life, and i bet i\u2019m not
        the only one who can say that. what is called the music business today, however,
        is not the business of producing music. at some point it became the business
        of selling cds in plastic cases, and that business will soon be over. but
        that\u2019s not bad news for music, and it\u2019s certainly not bad news for
        musicians. indeed, with all the ways to reach an audience, there have never
        been more opportunities for artists.\" (david byrne)\n\n\"music is about creative
        and passionate ideas. not product.\" (the free music movement)\n\n\"a free
        culture has been our past, but it will only be our future if we change the
        path we are on right now. a free culture is not a culture without property;
        it is not a culture in which artists don\u2019t get paid. a culture without
        property, or in which creators can\u2019t get paid, is anarchy, not freedom.
        we can carry a free culture into the twenty-first century, without artists
        losing and without the potential of digital technology being destroyed. common
        sense must revolt. it must act to free culture. soon, if this potential is
        ever to be realized.\" (lawrence lessig)\n\nwho inspired us: !k7, 12rec, 12tonar,

        and CEO of DIRTY Recordz professionally known as \u201c BEAZT\u201d, started
        creating and producing electronic music in the winter of 2010. His grimy sounds
        and sharp tones have a Dubstep and Drum and Bass persuasion, while also incorporating
        touching melodies with ripping basslines. His music can be described as heavy,
        fun and entertaining; music that keeps your attention and makes you want more
        BEAZT. Though this producer is new to Dubstep, he has been involved with electronic
        music for over ten years, DJing Drum and Bass at some of the hottest spots
        on the east coast with some of the biggest names in the industry. It is safe
        to say that this producer knows his music.\n2011 looks like an exciting time
        for BEAZT with music releasing on Heavy Artillery, Abducted, Mutated Sounds,
        and Twisted Monkey Records. GINDHOUSE, a chaotically filthy collaboration
        between BEAZT and PLAGUE, has been catching the attention of many tuned headphones.
        GRINDHOUSE is known for Dubstep influenced by heavy and chopped up double
        bass metal that is high in energy and headbanger ready.\nOne half of \"GRINDHOUSE\"
