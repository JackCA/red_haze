        a dope remix ep to a dope original song. ''Slow'' has been on wide rotation
        with djs ever since the original was releases on MRTN''s ''Slow What Turn''
        ep earlier this year. We even had a remix competition in association with
        Stoney Roads for ''Slow'' and winners of thet competition are now featured
        on this remix ep. As you may know, we enjoy all kinds on good music so remixers
        go from 80''s styled mixes to house to dubstep and even a rap version....
        not bad at all.\r\n\r\n\"Take one of Sweden\u00b4s biggest DJs, put him in
        a studio together with Robyn\u00b4s (yes, that blond girl) drummer and you
        get the producer duo: MRTN. DJ Mrtn (Sthlm Beat) and the drummer Pomp (Povel
        Olofsson) have worked together since spring of 2010. Now the fresh MRTN remixes
        are released on Top Billin. Featuring the vocals of lovely Lovisa Negga, this
        stunning remix pack is a keeper. \u2018Slow\u2019 is also already on wide
        rotation even on Swedish national radio and beat even SHM in the listening
        polls.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://soundcloud.com/mrtnofficial\r\n\r\nGet this release

        and vocal duo of Maaike Lebbing and Reija Lee (formally known as \"Kito \u0026
        Reija Lee\"). Two passionate Australian friends now based in London; the two
        draw inspiration from a vast selection of music that has sound tracked the
        love, lust and teenage rebellion that defines so much of what they''re about.
        Maaike\r\nand Reija''s first collaborative release came in the form of the
        game changing \"LFO\" that was released in early 2009 on Skream''s Disfigured
        Dubz imprint. Since then, they have worked together on a number of pieces
        for Mad Decent, including the \"Sweet Talk\" EP, and have now reunited under
        one name to explore a new style.\r\n\r\nTheir first single under the new FAUX
        NO moniker is called \"Velma Kelly\". A bass infused pop tune, it highlights
        both\r\nMaaike''s bombast percussion style with Reija''s melodic vocals. Along
        with the single we''ve got two remixes- one from recent Kito collaborator
        Feadz (Ed Banger) and a rapid-fire juke production from Norway''s Slick Shoota.\r\n\r\nOriginally

        and vocal duo of Maaike Lebbing and Reija Lee (formally known as \"Kito \u0026

        draw inspiration from a vast selection of music that has sound tracked the

        Dubz imprint. Since then, they have worked together on a number of pieces
