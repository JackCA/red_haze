        Angeles-born, New York City-based DJ/Producer Clockwork is no stranger to
        the world of electronic music. The young producer was one of the many 18 year
        olds circulating the dance music blogospehere with various bootleg remixes.
        But in 2011, armed with support and guidance from fellow young guns Felix
        Cartal and AutoErotique, Clockwork emerged from the throng of bedroom producers.
        His single \u201cSquad Up\u201d, an original track that was played out at
        festivals around the world, quickly caught the attention of internationally
        renowned DJ, and Dim Mak chief, Steve Aoki. Aoki signed Clockwork immediately,
        making him the youngest artist ever signed to Dim Mak\u2019s prolific roster.
        Since the signing, Clockwork has officially remixed work for artists across
        the dance music spectrum, from Steve Aoki to Dimitri Vegas. His bootleg remix
        of Avicii\u2019s notorious big room anthem \u201cLevels\u201d reached over
        80,000 plays on Soundcloud, 2 million views on Youtube, and garnered international
        radio play.\r\n\r\nClockwork\u2019s distinctive bass-heavy, big room sound
        has helped him gain support from the likes of Tiesto, Steve Angello, Laidback
        Luke, Steve Aoki, and everyone in between. His DJ sets are always as high
        energy and innovative as his productions, helping earn him an upcoming international
        tour as well as a spot on the line-up at the 2011 Hard Haunted Mansion Festival.
        With 2011 emerged the unique, big-room sounds that define Clockwork, but it
        truly is just the beginning. With a prolific propensity to create, a progressive
        production style, and a genuine love for the performance, Clockwork\u2019s
        future is looking bright.","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"clockworkhomie","website":null,"website_title":null,"online":true,"track_count":28,"playlist_count":3,"public_favorites_count":0,"followers_count":7375,"followings_count":0},{"id":2879548,"kind":"user","permalink":"jstnw","username":"jstreet","uri":"http://api.soundcloud.com/users/2879548","permalink_url":"http://soundcloud.com/jstnw","avatar_url":"http://i1.sndcdn.com/avatars-000006763043-urg7lt-large.jpg?2f6e0dc","country":"United

        / SYNTH / NOISE\r\n\r\nEvery artist claims to defy categorization. Yet for
        Jokers Of The Scene, it''s not a boast - it''s a lifestyle.\r\n\r\nFor the
        past few years, Jokers Of The Scene have ranked amongst the brightest, weirdest
        lights of Canada''s dance music renaissance. Between their Fool''s Gold originals
        and their enviably deep remixography, the duo have passed on a \"signature
        sound\" to craft an unpredictable approach that''s as cerebral as it is speaker-decimating.
        \r\n\r\nWhether crafting epic, nine minute Salem remixes or raving out with
        their own anthemic tracks like \u201cRevolting Joks\u201d and \u201cBaggy
        Bottom Boys,\u201d Toronto duo Jokers Of The Scene have proven themselves
        masters of electronic music in all its forms. Their latest project, the J0T5
        EP, may prove their most expansive yet, as Linus Booth and Chris Macintyre
        have created music perfect for home listening and strobe-lit warehouses alike.\r\n\r\nThe
        five tracks on J0T5 pulsate through ambient synth excursions, vintage sci-fi
        soundtracks, and experimental techno, somehow managing to connect the dots
        along the way. Equally diverse is the accompanying J0T5 RMXD EP.  Here, the
        duo\u2019s peers and contemporaries like Daniel Avery (aka Stopmakingme),
        Shadow Dancer (BNR), Hrdvsion (Wagon Repair), Savile \u0026 Olin, Cosmic Kids
        (Throne Of Blood), Gingy \u0026 Bordello (Turbo) and Babe Rainbow (Warp) each
        take turns driving the Jokers\u2019 new material into new and unexpected directions.\r\n\r\nKeep
        your antennae locked in to JOTS'' wavelength for whatever surprise comes next...

        Milicevic","city":"Belgrade","description":"Gramophonedzie\r\n\r\nMarko Milicevic
        is Gramophonedzie :  the MTV award winning Serbian superstar who is currently
        riding a serious wave following a remarkable breakthrough year in 2010. From
        his hometown of Belgrade, he has forged a loyal worldwide following for his
        distinctive productions and performances. \r\n\r\nWith his roots spanning
        a wide musical spectrum and a deep passion for funky music, live instruments
        and intensive vocals, production career began in 2000 when he was selected
        to study at the Red Bull Music Academy in Ireland. He subsequently completed
        a degree in Sound Design at Belgrade University and went onto produce soundtracks
        for a number of commercials, films and television as well as producing for
        several Serbian bands.\r\n\r\nGramophonedzie is best known for his smash hit
        release \u2018Why Don\u2019t You\u2019 \u2013 a jackin\u2019 house track that
        sampled Peggy Lee\u2019s swing standard \u2018Why Don\u2019t You Do Right\u2019.
        Initially signed to Guesthouse before being licensed to Positiva, \u2018Why
        Don\u2019t You\u2019 was one of the biggest club records of 2009 receiving
        widespread club support from the likes of Erick Morillo and Steve Angello
        to Dennis Ferrer and Louie Vega. It also received major radio support right
        across Europe with Giles Peterson (Radio 1) naming it his track of of the
        year. Upon being licensed to Postiva in early 2010, \u2018Why Don\u2019t You\u2019
        went onto hit #12 in the UK Sales Chart on its first week of release and remained
        in the Top 20 for several weeks. It also achieved major success throughout
        Europe hitting #7 and #13 in the Belgian and Dutch Sales Charts respectively
        . \u2018Why Don\u2019t You\u2019 has received in excess of 8,500,000 views
        on YouTube, continues to enjoy widespread international airplay across both
        TV and radio and remains a featured single in the i-Tunes \u2018Dance\u2019
        Chart.\r\n\r\nIn addition to \u2018Why Don\u2019t You\u2019, Marko has built
        an extensive discography of productions and remixes under the Gramophonedzie
        pseudonym on labels such as Gotta Keep Faith, Yazuka, Guesthouse, Nocturnal
        Groove, Oxyd, Shak Digital and his own Disko Zoo imprint. His latest single
        releases \u2013 \u2018Brazilian\u2019 (Nocturnal Groove) and \u2018Outta My
        Head\u2019 (Oxyd) \u2013 have both gained widespread club support from a range
        of leading tastemakers, been the subject of fierce licensing interest and
        featured extensively in the Beatport download charts. From a remix perspective,
        Marko has given the Gramophonedzie treatment to artists such as DJ Sneak (\u2018Cant
        Hide From My Bud\u2019), Mange Le Funk (\u2018I Still Want You\u2019), Professor
        Green (\u2018I Need You Tonight\u2019) and Doman \u0026 Gooding (\u2018Pacific
        State\u2019) while most recently he has remixed The Muthfankas (\u2018Gotta
        Hold On Me\u2019) and Kraak \u0026 Smaak (\u2018Calling Up\u2019). With a
        string of further releases lined up for 2011 and a new collaboration with
        Joey Negro forthcoming on Z Records it looks like Gramophonedzie will be keeping
        up the pressure.\r\n\r\nGramophonedzie has recently been voted \u2018Best
        Adria Act\u2019 during the 2010 MTV European Music Awards and was additionally
        nominated in the \u2018Best European Act\u2019 category alongside artists
        such as Enrique Inglesias, Swedish House Mafia and Marina \u0026 The Diamonds.  As
        a DJ, Marko tours internationally and has a dedicated dance floor congregation
        across the globe. In the last 12 months he has toured extensively throughout
        Europe as well as playing across Australia, Brazil and the U.S. and rocking
        dance floors in destinations such as Dubai, Russia and Indonesia. With his
        proven record, a full touring schedule and a host of new productions ready
        to drop, 2011 looks set to be another big year for Gramophonedzie.","discogs_name":null,"myspace_name":"gramophonedzie","website":"http://gramophonedzie.com","website_title":"Gramophonedzie","online":false,"track_count":33,"playlist_count":2,"public_favorites_count":1,"followers_count":8867,"followings_count":41},{"id":31037,"kind":"user","permalink":"dondiablo","username":"Don

        an idea to a painting, from a painting to a logo\u2026 In The Woods formed
        organically over the course of a hot NY summer in 2011. We are a conduit for
        music with no boundaries: samples, edits, originals and everything in between.
        With no A\u0026R restrictions, we set out to promote music of like-minded
        producers who understand the ethos that the deeper the rhythm, the better.
        This is music based on a groove, a feeling you get when your head sways back
        and forth like a tree in the woods. \r\n\r\n*The label is not accepting demos

        Pirupa","city":"","description":"What Pirupa has accomplished in 2 years is
        astounding and this is just the tip of the iceberg, making him one of the
        producers and DJs you have to watch. \nA talented DJ/producer from Italy,
        Pirupa has recently separated himself from the pack of successful producers
        by topping beatport''s charts with his last releases. Now with two of the
        most downloaded tracks on Beatport \"Sweet Devil\" in 2009 , \"Get Funky\"
        in 2010 and \"Party Non Stop\" in 2012, the sky''s the limit for this relentless
        talent from the small peninsula.\nReleased on impressive (well known) dance
        record labels in the world (Defected, Desolat, C\u00e8cille, Viva Music, Saved,
        Noir Music, Audio Therapy, Rebirth, Cr2, Snatch! Records, Suara, Stereo and
        Size Records to name few) Pirupa has recently remixed Sharam and the legendary
        Jamiroquai for Universal, more than Westboy, Riva Starr, NiCe7, Luca Agnelli,
        Pitto, Tube \u0026 Berger and Marascia among others.\nPirupa has accomplished
        this in a short period of time, building a reputation that takes most artists
        a lifetime to achieve. A feat like this can cause some people to sit back,
        relax, and acknowledge their own success but this has only caused Pirupa to
        work harder with new hot releases!\nHis success in the studio led to rank
        at  #11 in the Top100 Most Charted Artists of 2010 on Resident Advisor and
        has landed Pirupa gigs at some of the most prestigious clubs in the world,
        gracing the decks of many leading venues such as:\nSpace (Ibiza), Ministry
        Of Sound (London) Pacha (New York), Cielo (New York), D-Edge (Sao Paulo),
        La Kasa (Medellin), Nocturnal (Miami), Electric Pickle (Miami), Footwork (Toronto),
        Mint (Leeds), Mynt (Belfast), Culture Box (Copenaghen), Warehouse (Birmingham),
        Armani Club (Dubai), Cocoric\u00f2, Eliptica (Cali) , The End (Bogota), Echoes,
        Vola afc, Kindergarten, Prince, Folies de Pigalle...\n...and festivals like:\nSonar
        (Barcelona), Kazantip (Ukraina) and Surround Festival.\nHe has played alongside
        legends such as Pete Tong, Steve Lawler, Dj Vibe, Chus\u0026Ceballos, Paul
        Woolford, Sander Kleinenberg, Nick Curly, Smokin Jo and many more.\nPirupa\u2019s
        tracks are regularly supported and played by Pete Tong, Luciano, Carl Cox,
        Richie Hawtin, Paul Van Dyk, Loco Dice, Marco Carola, Danny Tenaglia, Dubfire,
        Nick Curly, Erick Morillo, Mathias Tanzmann, Steve Lawler, Nic Fanciulli,
